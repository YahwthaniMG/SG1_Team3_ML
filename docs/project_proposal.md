3. **Interpretability**: Explain which factors were most decisive for survival
4. **Storytelling**: Tell the human story behind statistical data
5. **Algorithm Comparison**: Evaluate multiple ML techniques per course requirements

## üîç Research Hypotheses

### **Main Hypothesis**
*"Titanic survival was primarily determined by the intersection of gender, social class, and age, reflecting 'women and children first' social norms modulated by economic power"*

### **Specific Hypotheses**

1. **H1 - Gender**: Women had significantly higher survival rates than men
2. **H2 - Social Class**: First-class passengers had higher survival than second and third class
3. **H3 - Age**: Children and young adults had an advantage over older adults
4. **H4 - Interaction**: The protective effect of female gender was amplified in higher social classes
5. **H5 - Family**: Family size had non-linear effects (medium families advantage, large families disadvantage)

### **Phase 2: Data Preparation**
- [ ] **Cleaning**: Handling missing values in Age, Cabin, Embarked
- [ ] **Feature Engineering**: 
  - Family size (SibSp + Parch)
  - Titles extracted from names (Mr, Mrs, Miss, Master)
  - Age and fare categorization
  - Interaction variables (gender √ó class)
- [ ] **Encoding**: Categorical to numeric variables
- [ ] **Scaling**: Numeric variable normalization

### **Phase 3: Modeling**
- [ ] **Split**: Train/Validation/Test (70/15/15)
- [ ] **Baseline**: Simple model for comparison
- [ ] **Algorithms to implement**:
  - Logistic Regression (interpretability)
  - Random Forest (handling interactions)
  - Support Vector Machine (complex boundaries)
  - Naive Bayes (probabilistic baseline)
- [ ] **Cross-validation**: K-fold for robustness
- [ ] **Hyperparameter tuning**: Grid search for optimization

### **Phase 4: Evaluation and Comparison**
- [ ] **Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC
- [ ] **Comparison**: Performance table by algorithm
- [ ] **Feature importance**: Identify most predictive variables
- [ ] **Error analysis**: Misclassified cases

### **Phase 5: Interpretation and Storytelling**
- [ ] **Hypothesis validation**: Confirm/refute initial hypotheses
- [ ] **Historical insights**: Connect findings with historical context
- [ ] **Final visualizations**: Charts that tell the story
- [ ] **Recommendations**: Lessons for modern emergency protocol design
